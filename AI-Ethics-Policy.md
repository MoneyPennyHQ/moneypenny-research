# Personal AI Compliance Framework for Doctoral Research

## Ethical Guidelines for Transparent AI Integration in Academic Writing

**Author:** Emily (Penny) Penick  
**Institution:** PhD Candidate, University of Waikato  
**Version:** 1.0

## Purpose and Scope

This document establishes my personal framework for ethical and transparent use of generative AI tools during my doctoral research, in full compliance with the University of Waikato Guidelines for Student Use of Generative AI Tools (University of Waikato, 2023). This framework is designed to ensure academic integrity while leveraging AI as a legitimate research and writing tool that enhances rather than replaces human intellectual contribution.

## Foundational Principles

### 1. Transparency
All AI use will be acknowledged to supervisors. I commit to maintaining detailed records of how and why AI tools are employed, following current scholarly recommendations for transparent AI disclosure.

### 2. Intellectual Ownership
AI tools serve as sophisticated writing and research assistants, not content creators. All ideas, arguments, and scholarly contributions remain my own intellectual work. As Bozkurt (2024, p. 5) emphasizes, human authors must maintain "primary responsibility for the content."

### 3. Critical Engagement
All AI outputs will be critically evaluated, fact-checked against credible sources, and integrated only after human review and verification. This aligns with scholarly calls for "empirical research and in-depth engagement with ethical theory and philosophy of education" needed to adequately assess AI challenges in educational contexts (Wieczorek et al., 2025, p. 1).

## Permitted and Prohibited Uses

### ✓ Approved Applications

- **Grammar and syntax checking:** Using AI to improve sentence structure, clarity, and flow
- **Structural organization:** Requesting suggestions for logical arrangement of arguments
- **Brainstorming counterarguments:** Testing the strength of my ideas through AI dialogue
- **Citation formatting:** Assistance with reference style compliance
- **Writing feedback:** Requesting analysis of clarity, coherence, and academic tone
- **Research organization:** Help with categorizing sources and identifying patterns
- **Translation assistance:** For non-English academic sources
- **Literature search:** Secondary to traditional library searches, using AI to find relevant sources to read

### ✗ Prohibited Uses

- **Idea generation:** AI will not be used to develop core arguments or research insights
- **Content creation:** No direct copying of AI-generated text without substantial human revision
- **Data fabrication:** AI will never be used to create fake citations, sources, or research data
- **Assignment completion:** AI will not complete assignments independently
- **Original analysis:** Critical interpretation of research findings remains exclusively human work

## Quality Assurance and Ethical Safeguards

### Critical Evaluation Standards
As required by University guidelines, I will:
- Verify all factual information using credible academic sources
- Cross-check any AI-suggested references for accuracy
- Consult supervisors when uncertain about AI-generated content reliability
- Prioritize peer-reviewed sources over AI-generated information (University of Waikato, 2023)

### Privacy Protection
Following University guidelines to "respect privacy and confidentiality and avoid sharing sensitive personal information with generative AI tools" (University of Waikato, 2023):
- No confidential research data will be shared with AI tools
- Participant information and sensitive institutional data remain protected
- Personal information of research subjects will never be processed through AI

### Academic Integrity Compliance
- Full compliance with the University of Waikato Guidelines for Student Use of Generative AI Tools
- Alignment with academic integrity principles
- Recognition that AI tools are "machines that employ algorithms," not human collaborators (University of Waikato, 2023)

## Documentation and Transparency Considerations

While basic AI use disclosure is essential, I remain open to implementing more detailed documentation protocols if deemed appropriate by supervisors or institutional requirements.

## Professional Development and Contribution

### Workplace Preparation
This framework recognizes that AI literacy is essential for future academic and professional work, as "generative AI has the potential to become a highly used tool in both the academic sphere and the future workplace" (University of Waikato, 2023). My approach aims to develop:
- Ethical AI use practices transferable to post-doctoral career
- Critical evaluation skills for AI-augmented work environments
- Transparent documentation habits for collaborative research contexts

### Contribution to Emerging Scholarship
My documented AI use methodology may contribute to emerging scholarship on:
- Ethical AI integration in doctoral research
- Best practices for transparent AI use in academic writing
- Methodological innovation in humanities research

## Review and Adaptation

This framework will be reviewed regularly with supervisors and updated as University policies evolve, new AI tools become available, and research needs change throughout my doctoral program. I commit to regular discussion of AI use in supervision meetings and will modify practices based on supervisor feedback and institutional updates.

## Scholarly Context and Supporting Literature

This framework is grounded in current scholarly discourse on AI ethics in education. Recent research supports the approach outlined above and suggests that existing Research Ethics Committee (REC) models can effectively support consideration of ethical issues in AI research (Knight et al., 2025):

Bozkurt (2024, p. 5) notes that "in response to these emerging challenges, and to maintain transparency and uphold academic integrity, numerous academic journals have updated their editorial policies... the focus is on encouraging authors to be transparent about the extent of its use."

Furthermore, Bozkurt (2024, p. 5) argues that "given the near-impossibility of avoiding the use of generative AI tools in education, owing to their ease of use and usefulness... banning these technologies is not considered as a viable solution... Therefore, the development of solutions that align with academic integrity principles seems to be imperative."

Bozkurt (2024, p. 5) also emphasizes that "this dual nature of generative AI calls for a balanced approach that leverages its benefits while vigilantly safeguarding against its potential misuse in academic contexts. The challenge lies in maintaining the integrity of academic work, ensuring that the use of AI aligns with the established values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage."

Additionally, Wieczorek et al.'s (2025, p. 15) systematic review of AI ethics in education emphasizes that "education scholars and philosophers of education should focus on developing new approaches to teaching and learning alongside AI, as well as lists of best practices that would help educators navigate the technologically-augmented landscape."

## Conclusion

This framework positions AI as a powerful tool for enhancing the quality, clarity, and organization of my scholarly work while maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity. By exceeding basic compliance requirements through documentation and critical reflection, I aim to model responsible AI use for the academic community.

My approach recognizes that generative AI has significant potential in academic and workplace contexts (University of Waikato, 2023) while ensuring that the integrity of my learning remains uncompromised. This framework contributes to ongoing scholarly discussions about ethical AI integration and represents a commitment to transparent, critically engaged academic practice.
